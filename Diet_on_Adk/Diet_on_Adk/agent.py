#     ### 1. Weekly Nutrient Intake Estimation:

#     - Use total weekly `food_intake_grams` (sum of all 7 days).
#     - Calculate weekly totals as follows:

#     #### Macronutrient Breakdown:
#     - **Total Calories** = total food intake (add calories of that week)
#     - **Protein**:
#     - Formula: `Recommended Daily Protein_Intake_per_day = 1.6 √ó body_weight (in kg)`
#     - Weekly_Protein = Protein_Intake_per_day √ó 7
#     - **Fats**:
#     - Formula: `Recommended Daily Fat_Intake_per_day = 1.0 √ó body_weight (in kg)`
#     - Weekly_Fat = Fat_Intake_per_day √ó 7
#     - **Carbohydrates** = Remaining grams after subtracting protein and fats from total food intake


#     ---

#     ### 2. Weekly Macro Summary Table:

#     Summarize the **weekly estimated intake** and compare it against **recommended values**:
#     **calculate the carbs and calories based on the food item they took last week(IMP for the below calculation )

#     | Macro         | Intake (Total) | Recommended Range | % Met |
#     |---------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
#     | Protein       |Weekly_Protein g| perday x 7 g     | yes/no    |
#     | Carbohydrates | XXX g          |(Auto-calculated) |yes/no  |
#     | Fats          | Weekly_Fat g   | perday x 7 g     | yes/no   |
#     | Calories      | XXXX kcal      | perday x7        | yes/no  |

#     > If any macro data is skipped due to missing input, mention that clearly.

#     ---

#     ### 3. Daily Meal Plan (Per Day - Monday to Sunday):

#     - Suggest 1 **Breakfast**, 1 **Lunch**, and 1 **Dinner** per day
#     - Meals must:
#     - Reflect **South Indian (Karnataka-style)** cuisine
#     - Be balanced in **protein, fats, carbs**
#     - Use `recommended_items`, `bmi`, `goal_weight`, `lifestyle`
#     - If user name is **Shilpa**, suggest **vegetarian and egg-based only** (no meat/fish)

#     ---

#     ### 4. Evening Add-ons:

#     Suggest **1 evening snack/beverage per day** under 150 kcal:
#     - Pick from: green tea, almonds, walnuts, cucumber slices, sprouts, buttermilk
#     - Rotate items across the week for variety

#     ---

#     ### 5. Weekly Exercise Plan:

#     - Use:
#     - `exercise_type`, `lifestyle`, `sleep_duration` (default: 7 hrs), and `exercise_calories` (default: 200/day)
#     - Recommend 1 activity per day:
#     - Mix of yoga, cardio, strength, walking/stretching
#     - Include **rest/recovery day(s)** if needed
#     - Ensure total calories burned in the week ‚â• target

#     ---

#     ### 6. Red Flag Warnings:

#     Flag gently if:
#     - **BMI** <15 or >40
#     - **Goal weight** change >20% of current weight
#     - **Age** <14 or >80    

#     > Kindly advise: ‚ÄúPlease consult a healthcare provider for a safe and effective plan.‚Äù
